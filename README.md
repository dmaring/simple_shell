# shell

The shell that we use daily is a sometimes taken for granted.  It affords us many capabilities that allow us to work, code, and play.  Its the starting point of all that we do as developers.  This project allows the authors to explore the inner workings of the shell to better understand how it works.  We attempt to recreate the shells functionality and many capabilities.
