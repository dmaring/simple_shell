.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[options][file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell 
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter. 
It displays a prompt and waits for user to type a command. 
Prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed. 
This shell has limited features so no piping, redirection, aliases, expansion, and no arguments passed to programs. 
If executable cannot be found, error message is printed and prompt displayed again.
.PP
Uses spaces as delimiter between each argument. Common flags are interpreted. 
.PP
Can be invoked by typing ./hsh

.SH EXAMPLE
Invocate interactive mode by typing ./hsh in terminal. The prompt will ask for input. By typing 
.I /bin/ls 
or
.I ls
into the terminal, the contents of the current directory should be displayed.
This shell can also be used in non-interactive mode by piping commands into it as such:
.I echo "ls" | ./hsh

.SH EXIT STATUS
If the shell is in non-interactive mode, the execution of the shell file will be aborted.
If the shell exits with error, it will be a non-zero exit status. Otherwise it will return the exit status of the last command executed, or an exit status can be appended by the user 
.I exit (number).
